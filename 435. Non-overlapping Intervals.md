Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:
You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
Example 1:
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:
Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]

Output: 2

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping

Thoughts: 
first, sort the intervals; then compare adjacent 2 intervals:
if the 2nd interval does not overlap with the 1st, the following intervals of course wouldn't overlap with the 1st.
if it does, look at the larger 'end' and remove it
```java
/**
 * Definition for an interval.
 * public class Interval {
 *     int start;
 *     int end;
 *     Interval() { start = 0; end = 0; }
 *     Interval(int s, int e) { start = s; end = e; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(Interval[] intervals) {
        if(intervals.length<2)
            return 0;
        //sort
        Arrays.sort(intervals, new Comparator(){
            @Override
            public int compare(Object o1, Object o2){
                if(((Interval)o1).start==((Interval)o2).start && ((Interval)o1).end==((Interval)o2).end)
                    return 0;
                if(((Interval)o1).start<((Interval)o2).start || (((Interval)o1).start==((Interval)o2).start && ((Interval)o1).end<((Interval)o2).end))
                    return -1;
                else 
                    return 1;
            }
        });
        int count = 0;
        int i=0,j=1;
        while(i<intervals.length && j<intervals.length){
            if(intervals[j].start>=intervals[i].end){
                i=j;
            }else{
                count++;
                if(intervals[i].end>=intervals[j].end){
                    i=j;
                }
            }
            j++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
