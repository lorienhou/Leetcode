Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

Thoughts:
1. sort array based on h decreasingly, if h is the same, sort k increasingly. Because for (a, n) and (a, m), if (a,n) is before (a,m) and n>=m, there're n elements before (a,n) that are larger/equal to a, so there must be at lease n+1 elements before (a,m) that are larger/equal to a, including (a,n). Therefor m>=n+1 which objects to the assumption that n>=m.
2. scan array from head to tail, put each node (h,k) in the position identified by k, because everything already in the list is larger/equal to the current height.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        		if (people.length<2)
            return people;
        //sort
        for (int i=0;i<people.length;i++) {
            for (int j=0;j<people.length-1-i;j++) {
                if (people[j][0]<people[j+1][0] || (people[j][0]==people[j+1][0] && people[j][1]>people[j+1][1])) {
                    //swap j with j+1
                    int temp0 = people[j][0];
                    int temp1 = people[j][1];
                    people[j][0] = people[j+1][0];
                    people[j][1] = people[j+1][1];
                    people[j+1][0] = temp0;
                    people[j+1][1] = temp1;
                }
            }
        }
        //put
        List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<int[]>();
        //int pre = people[0][0];
        int ind = -1;//previous index
        for (int i=0;i<people.length;i++) {
            ind = people[i][1];
            int[] temp = new int[2];
            temp[0] = people[i][0];
            temp[1] = people[i][1];
            list.add(ind, temp);
            //pre = people[i][0];
        }
        //put to result
        for (int i=0;i<people.length;i++) {
            people[i][0] = list.get(i)[0];
            people[i][1] = list.get(i)[1];
        }
        return people;
    }
}
```
