In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

Note:
The given numbers of 0s and 1s will both not exceed 100
The size of given string array won't exceed 600.
Example 1:
Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”
Example 2:
Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2

Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".
Thoughts:
we remember the max number of words that can be formed with different value combination of i and j, and use dp
```java
public class Solution {
    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {
        int[][] count = new int[strs.length][2];
        for (int i=0; i<strs.length; i++) {
            count[i] = count(strs[i]);
        }
        //dp[i][j] means after we examined a number of strs, 
        //currently what's the max number of strings we can form with i 0s and j 1s
        int[][] dp = new int[m+1][n+1];
        for (int k=0; k<strs.length; k++) {
            String s = strs[k];
            for (int i=m; i>=count[k][0]; i--) {
                for (int j=n; j>=count[k][1]; j--) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(1 + dp[i-count[k][0]][j-count[k][1]], dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
    
    private int[] count(String s) {
        int[] result = new int[2];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray())
            if (c == '0')
                result[0]++;
            else
                result[1]++;
        return result;
    }
}
```
