Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

Thoughts: priority queue
```java
public class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        Map<Character,Integer> freq = new HashMap<Character,Integer>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        	freq.put(c, freq.get(c)==null ? 1 : (freq.get(c)+1));
        }
        PriorityQueue<MyObj> q = new PriorityQueue<MyObj>();
        for (Character c : freq.keySet()) {
        	MyObj o = new MyObj(freq.get(c), c);
        	q.offer(o);
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
        	MyObj o = q.poll();
        	for (int i=0;i<o.freq;i++)
        		sb.append(o.c);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
	class MyObj implements Comparable{
		int freq;
		char c;
		public MyObj (int f, char c) {
			this.freq = f;
			this.c = c;
		}

		@Override
		public int compareTo(Object o) {
			MyObj other = (MyObj) o;
			if (this.freq==other.freq)
				return 0;
			if (this.freq<other.freq)
				return 1;
			return -1;
		}
		public String toString() {
			return c+"";
		}
	}
}
```
