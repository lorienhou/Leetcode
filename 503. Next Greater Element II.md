Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

Thoughts:
consider a new array made of 2 original arrays
keep a stack of positions that have not found the next greater elements yet. this stack must be descending
check the next value in new array with the top of the stack repeatedly. 
if less/equal, add to stack;
if larger, put it in the corresponding position in result, keep doing this until smaller than top of stack; put it to stack
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(result, -1);
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        for (int i=0;i<2*n;i++) {
            int num = nums[i%n];
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()]<num) {//stack will have at most nums.length elements
                result[stack.pop()] = num;
            }
            if (i<n)
                stack.push(i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
