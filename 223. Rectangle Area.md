Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Rectangle Area
Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        //2 areas minus overlapping area
        //find overlapping width and height respectively
        int areas = (C - A) * (D - B) + (G - E) * (H - F);
        
        int largerLeft = (int) Math.max(A, E);
        int smallerRight = (int) Math.min(C, G);
        int w = largerLeft < smallerRight ? (smallerRight - largerLeft) : 0;
        if (w == 0)
            return areas;
        int largerBtm = (int) Math.max(B, F);
        int smallerTop = (int) Math.min(D, H);
        int h = largerBtm < smallerTop ? (smallerTop - largerBtm) : 0;
        return areas - w * h;
    }
}
```
