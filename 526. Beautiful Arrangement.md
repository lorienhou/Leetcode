Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 ? i ? N) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
Note:
N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countArrangement(int N) {
        boolean[] used = new boolean[N+1];
        int[] arrange = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(used, false);
        int result = helper(arrange, 0, used, N);
        return result;
    }
    private int helper(int[] arrange, int pos, boolean[] used, int n) {
        int ways = 0;
        if (pos > n-1)
            return 1;
        for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            if (used[i])
                continue;
            if ((pos+1) % i == 0 || i % (pos+1) == 0) {
                arrange[pos] = i;
                used[i] = true;
                int subWays = helper(arrange, pos + 1, used, n);
                ways += subWays;
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
        return ways;
    }
}
```
