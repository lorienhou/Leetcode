Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Thoughts:
Obviously a window is maintained.
Each time we increase the window by examining a new element, we need to check if the difference between it and the largest value in the window is less than t and also check if the difference between it and the smallest value in the window is less than t.
To do that, we need to maintain a sorted set of all values in the window.
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(int[] nums, int k, int t) {
        TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<Integer>();
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            int val = nums[i];
            if((set.floor(val)!=null && val<=t+set.floor(val))
            || (set.ceiling(val)!=null && set.ceiling(val)<=t+val))
                return true;
            set.add(val);
            if(i>=k)
                set.remove(nums[i-k]);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
