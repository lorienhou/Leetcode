Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Thoughts: divide and conquer
```java
public class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        //count height by going down far left
        int h = 0;
        TreeNode cur = root;
        while (cur.left != null) {
            cur = cur.left;
            h++;
        }
        int totalH = h;
        TreeNode subRoot = root;
        int countLeaves = 0;
        //check height of rightmost leaf of left subtree
        while (h > 0) {
            cur = subRoot.left;
            int subH = 1;
            if (cur == null) {
                subRoot = null;
                break;
            }
            while (cur.right != null) {
                cur = cur.right;
                subH++;
            }
            if (subH == h) {//cutoff must be in root.right
                subRoot = subRoot.right;
                countLeaves += (int)Math.pow(2, h-1);
                h--;
            } else {
                subRoot = subRoot.left;
                h--;
            }
        }
        //final count
        return (int)Math.pow(2, totalH) - 1 + countLeaves + (subRoot == null ? 0 : 1);
    }
}
```
