Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
Thoughts:
sort it. we try to find a point in the middle such that the sum of differences between this point and all the points are smallest,
and we want to know that sum of difference.
for 2 points at the 2 ends, no matter where that middle point is, the sum is the same. Use this logic
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int midVal = nums[nums.length/2];
        for(int i : nums){
            count += Math.abs(midVal - i);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
