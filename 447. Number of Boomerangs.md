Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).

Example:
Input:
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
Thoughts:
brute force..
first loop: take each point as the mid of the boomerang.
second loop: keep checking distance between each other points and the mid, keep track of the number of the same distance in a map, whenever another point comes that has the same distance as in the map, it means that new point can pair with each of the x points corresponding to that distance stored in the map. for each the pairs, we count 2 since order matters.
```java
public class Solution {
    public int numberOfBoomerangs(int[][] points) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<points.length;i++){
            Map<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
            for(int j=0;j<points.length;j++){
                if(i==j)
                    continue;
                int dis = (points[i][0]-points[j][0])*(points[i][0]-points[j][0])+
                            (points[i][1]-points[j][1])*(points[i][1]-points[j][1]);
                if(m.get(dis)==null){
                    m.put(dis, 1);
                }else{
                    count += m.get(dis)*2;
                    m.put(dis, m.get(dis)+1);
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
