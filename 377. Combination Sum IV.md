Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
Follow up:
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

Thoughts:
for a certain target, we have decompose it by substracting each of the numbers i in the array.
we find the results for each of the substraction target-i and add them up.
for the way of decomposing target to target + 0, it is one way, so dp[0]=1, this is the tricky part.
```java
public class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        int dp[] = new int[target+1];
        dp[0] = 1; //tricky: for this combination [target], the number of ways is 1, which is dp[0]
        for(int i=1;i<=target;i++){
            for(int j : nums){
                if(j<=i)
                    dp[i] += dp[i-j];
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
}
```
