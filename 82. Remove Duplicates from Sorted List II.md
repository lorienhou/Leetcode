Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

For example,
Given 1->2->3->3->4->4->5, return 1->2->5.
Given 1->1->1->2->3, return 2->3.

Thoughts: use dummy first of all. Always keep track of tail of final list, and keep comparing next node with 2nd next node. when repeated nodes are found, keep advancing until a different value is found.
```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null)
            return head;
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode pre = dummy;
        head = pre;
        while (head.next != null && head.next.next != null) {
            //keep comparing next with next.next
            if (head.next.val == head.next.next.val) {
                //find next different value
                while (head.next.next != null && head.next.val == head.next.next.val) {
                    head = head.next;
                }
                pre.next = head.next.next;
                head = pre;
            } else {
                pre = pre.next;
                head = pre;
            }
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
