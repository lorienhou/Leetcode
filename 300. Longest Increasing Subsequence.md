Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

Thoughts: dp[n] longest number of subsequence. Each time we examine a new number, traverse the number before it, 
for the ones the new number is larger than, remember the largest dp value, in the end add one to the largest dp value.
```java
public class Solution {
    //let l[i] be the length of the longest seq ending at nums[i]
	public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length<2)
            return nums.length;
        int[] l = new int[nums.length];
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(i==0)
                l[0] = 1;
            else{
                int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                for(int j=0;j<i;j++){
                    if(nums[i]>nums[j]){
                        if(max<l[j]+1)
                            max = l[j]+1;
                    }else{//if everything before nums[i] is less, length is 1
                        if(max<1)
                        	max = 1;
                    }
                }
                l[i] = max;
            }
        }
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int i : l)
        	if(max < i)
        		max = i;
        	
        return max;
    }
}
```
